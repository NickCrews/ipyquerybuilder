# ipyquerybuilder

An ipywidget for building SQL (and other) queries.

This uses the `ipyreact` and `anywidget` libraries to
wrap the javascript [React Query Builder](https://react-querybuilder.js.org/)
library.

I started down this path, but it ended up not being exactly what I was
looking for. So this is somehwat usable, but not really yet. 
Mostly I'm putting this up here in case it is helpful for someone else.
